The Document interface, and it's iterators and implemented classes provides a uniform method of interacting with corpora so that methods calling `reader` have a uniform means of iterating through many document files.  The provided Document related classes are:
   * `FileDocument`, for single file with a single document
   * `StringDocument`, for documents represented as a single string
   * `FileListDocumentIterator`, for single file which is a list of other files, each containing documents
   * `OneLinePerDocumentIterator`, for a single file which one document contained on a single line
In addition to these, a `WordIterator` is provided, such that it will automagically tokenize a `BufferedReader` and provided an iterator for each word read.
