Q: What would be a useful classpath?

A: For Linux users using bash, one can do:
export CLASSPATH=bin/:classes/:.
for csh one can do:
setenv CLASSPATH "bin/:classes/:."

This will allow you to easily run ant at the base of the sspace directory, and immediate run any of the runnable classes produced from the same directory.
