#summary Java Frequently Asked Questions when using the S-Space Package

= FAQ =

== Q: What would be a useful classpath? ==

A: For Linux users using `bash`, one can do:
{{{
export CLASSPATH=bin/:classes/:.
}}}
for `csh` one can do:
{{{
setenv CLASSPATH "bin/:classes/:."
}}}

This will allow you to easily run ant at the base of the sspace directory, and immediate run any of the runnable classes produced from the same directory.

== What are good JVM options to use? ==

We recommend running with the largest maximum heap allowable on the system.  For example, for a machine with 4 gigabytes of memory, the JVM would be invoked with the `-Xmx4g` option.  We also recommend using the latest server JVM.
