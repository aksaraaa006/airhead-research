#summary File formats used by the S-Space package.

= `.sspace` Formats =

The command-line executable programs produce semantic spaces and save them as `.sspace` files.  We use two file formats: binary and text.  The default for all command line programs is to produce a text.  

=== text format ===

Each word and vector is represented on its own line.  A word is delineated from its vector by a `|` character.  The vector values are space delimited.  For example, a semantic space with 3 words and 4 dimensions would look like:
{{{
red|0 1 0 0
blue|1 0 0 1
green|0 0 1 0
purple|1 1 0 1
}}}
Any white space in the original word, e.g. "white house", is preserved in the .sspace output.  The vectors values will be written as double-precision floating point numbers.

The text format is convenient for processing small spaces and verifying that the vectors are what is expected (or at the very least, non-zero).  This format is also very portable and is easily loaded by other programming languages, should that be required.

=== binary format ===

In the binary format, the entire semantic space is written in one continuous stream.  The format is specified as:

  # an eight byte header consisting of two ints (four bytes each; high byte first) for the number of words in the space, and the number of dimensions in the space. 
  # Then each word in the space is appended in the following format.
    # The word is encoded in a Modified UTF-8 (see [http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/DataInput.html#modified-utf-8 here]  for more information on the encoding format). 
    # Each of the values for the vector dimensions is appended as an eight-byte double (high byte first).

This format is preferable for faster serializing and deserializing.  Furthermore, `.sspace` files in this format are much smaller, so this format is preferred if the semantic space is large, or if disk space is an issue. 

We recommend that large semantic spaces uses this format.

 

In the future we may also support sparse formats, as demand or available time increases.

= Input Document File Formats =

All of the command line programs use one of two input file formats for creating the semantic space: document-file format and the file-list format.  

=== Document File Format ===

The document file format is a condensed format where an entire corpus is represented in a single file.  Each document in the corpus is represented on a single line.  This often required some preprocessing of the original corpus to remove new lines from a document.

We prefer this format because it greatly reduced the I/O access for processing an entire corpus.  When the file system needs to access each document as a separate file, the cost of opening, seeking to, and closing each file can significantly outweigh the actual semantic space processing time.

As an added benefit, this file format also lets semantic space users experiment with different levels of "document" granularity for co-occurrence models that don't normally work with documents.  Specifically, the "document" in this case defines a boundary across which co-occurrence are not counted.  For example, in the sentences, "The software is written in Java.  The programs are portable," if each sentence was counted as a separate document, then "Java" and "programs" would not count as co-occurring.  

=== File List Format ===

In the file list format, each document is stored in a separate file.  The files are then combined into a list with one per line.  For example:
{{{
$ cat my-file-list.txt
file-1.txt
/tmp/downloaded-file.txt
corpus/my-doc.txt
}}}
`my-file-list.txt` contains three documents.

This format is convenient if the documents are already represented by files, and you just want to try generating a space.  (e.g. `ls -1` use to generate the file list)  However for most systems, the execution time will grow significantly as the corpus size grows.

= Matrix File Formats =

The S-Space package internally supports several matrix file formats.  These are based on the [http://tedlab.mit.edu/~dr/svdlibc/ SVDLIBC] matrix file formats, Matlab and Octave sparse matrix file formats, and our own format.
