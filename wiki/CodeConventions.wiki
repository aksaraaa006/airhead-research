#summary Coding standards for the SSpace code packages

We use an extension of the Java coding conventions: [http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConvTOC.doc.html]

With regards to spacing, there are a few rules:
  * No tabs should be use.
  * Every indentation uses 4 spaces.
  * Every class starts with a new line.
  * Major code blocks should be separated with a new line.
  * If a method declaration is split, the arguments should all line up.
     * Indentations must be at least 4 spaces deeper than the code indentation.
  * If a method declaration is split, any thows statements must be indented by 8 spaces.
